# Redux-News-Reader-Project

This project from Codecademy is about article and comments, when the article changes, then you can fetch the comments asynchronously for that article and add them
to your store, so they display under your article.
Likewise, when a user submits a new comment, you will submit it to the server via. asynchronous request and display it in the article's list of comments.
To employ to this project, we will use the function createSlice and createAsyncThunk from the reduxjs/toolkit.
